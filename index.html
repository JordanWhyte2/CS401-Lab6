<h1>TypeScript Tutorial for Javascipt Devlopers</h1>

<p>Typescript is similar to Javascipt but adds another layer of a type system on top of it. </p>
  
<p>Typescript consistently checks that you assign language primitives like strings and numbers.</p>

<br>
<p>For example, if we initialize a string with Javascript 
  
  <br><br> <i>let helloWorld = "Hello World";</i>  <br><br> 
  
Typescript will see the value is a string, and define its type as string </p>
